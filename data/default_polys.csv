This file contains default polynomials to be used as modulus for polynomial lattice rules.
A part from the first polynomial of degree 0, all the polynomials are irreducible.
In fact, all the polynomials apart from the two first ones are primitive polynomials.
This list of polynomials is extracted from http://www.partow.net/programming/polynomials/index.html
