/** \page cmdtut Command-Line Tutorial

This tutorial teaches how to use the LatNet Builder command-line tool to
search for highly uniform point sets.

It is assumed in the examples that the <code>latnetbuilder</code>
executable program can be found by the user's shell.  If it is not the case, the
full path to the executable program, for example
<code>/path/to/latnetbuilder</code>, should be used in the place of just
<code>latnetbuilder</code>.

Alternatively, the \ref gui can be used to construct a command line, to
invoke the command-line tool and to see the results.


This tutorial is divided in three sections:
 - \subpage cmdtut_quickrecipes
    \n This section gives a quick overview on how to use the software.
 - \subpage cmdtut_spec
    \n This section gives more advanced details on how to use the different \ref feats "features" of the software in the command-line tool.
 - \subpage cmdtut_summary
    \n This section summarizes all the options of the command-line tool.

The following typesetting semantics are adopted:
- <code>verbatim</code> for text to be typed as is;
- <code><var>arg</var></code> for text to be substituted;
- when a command is broken into multiple lines, a trailing backslash (\\)
  indicates that the command is continued on the next line.
