\section cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_types Switching between point set types

LatNet Builder can handle two main \ref feats_pointsets "point set types": 
- \ref feats_pointsets_latrank1 "lattice rules";
- \ref feats_pointsets_net "digital nets".

The switch between these two types of points can be operated using the option
<code>--set-type</code> which can take the following values:
    - <code>--set-type lattice</code>
      to search for lattice rules; or
    - <code>--set-type net</code>
      to search for digital nets.

\section cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_lat Lattice rules

\subsection cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_lat_construction Types of lattice rules

Two types of lattice rules are supported by LatNet Builder:
- \ref feats_pointsets_latrank1_ord "ordinary lattice rules";
- \ref feats_pointsets_latrank1_poly "polynomial lattice rules".

The switch between these two types of lattices can be operated using the option
<code>--construction</code> which can take the following values:
    - <code>--construction ordinary</code>
      to search for ordinary lattice rules; or
    - <code>--construction polynomial</code>
      to search for polynomial lattice rules.


\subsection cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_lat_size Size of lattice rules

The option <code>--size-parameter</code> can be used to specify the size (number of points) of a lattice rule. 

Recall that for ordinary lattice rules, the modulus is exactly
the number of points. In this case, we directly specify the modulus.
For instance, to specify an ordinary lattice rule with 6977 points, use <code>--size-parameter 6977</code>.
It is also possible to specify the number of points as a power of a base. For instance <code>--size-parameter 3^10</code> is also a valid expression.

For polynomial lattice rules, the number of points equals two to the power of the degree of its modulus. 
The number of points will thus always be a power of two. 
In the case of unilevel point sets, one can specify the number of points of the polynomial 
lattice rule to equal \f$2^k\f$ with <code>--size-parameter 2^<var>k</var></code>. In this case, a predefined polynomial with degree 
\f$k\f$ will be chosen as modulus for the lattice. All the predefined polynomials are irreducible so that they can be used
with the fast-CBC exploration method. These polynomials are from <a href="http://www.partow.net/programming/polynomials/index.html"> Arash Partow </a>.

Otherwise, one can also specify a custom polynomial modulus. The number of points will be two to the power of its degree.
Polynomials are specified as a sequence of coefficients (ordered by increasing degree). For instance \f$ 1 + z^2 + z^5 \f$ can be specified by
<code>101001</code>. 
Additionally, one can raise the polynomial to an integer power. For instance <code>--size-parameter 01^8</code> tells LatNet Builder that the modulus of the polynomial lattice is
\f$z^8\f$. Note that it is always necessary to specify a custom modulus (as a power of a base modulus) when one constructs an embedded polynomial lattice rule.

\subsection cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_lat_specify How to construct a specific lattice rule

To construct a specific lattice rule, for instance to evaluate its merit value or to extend it,
one must specify its generating vector. LatNet Builder uses the following convention: a generating vector is described
by a dash-separated list of integers or polynomials, depending on whether the lattice is ordinary or polynomial.

- An ordinary generating vector is a dash-separated list of integers.
- A polynomial generating vector is a dash-separated list of polynomials (specified as explained above). 

In the Command-Line Tutorial, any occurrence of <code><var>genVec</var></code> or <code><var>point-set-description</var></code> with 
<code>--set-type lattice </code> can be replaced by such a list.
For instance to specify an ordinary lattice with generating vector \f$(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)\f$, replace <code><var>genVec</var></code> with
<code>1-2-3-5-7-11</code>.

\section cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_net Digital nets

\subsection cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_net_construction Digital net constructions

Three constructions of \ref feats_pointsets_net "digital nets" are supported by LatNet Builder:
- \ref feats_pointsets_net_sobol "Sobol' nets";
- \ref feats_pointsets_net_poly "polynomial lattice rules";
- \ref feats_pointsets_net_explicit "digital nets with explicit generating matrices".

The switch between these three constructions can be operated using the option
<code>--construction</code> which can take the following values:
    - <code>--construction sobol</code>
      to search for Sobol' nets;
    - <code>--construction polynomial</code>
      to search for polynomial lattice rules; or
    - <code>--construction explicit</code>
      to search for with digital nets with explicit generating matrices.

\subsection cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_net_size Size of digital nets

Recall that the number of points of a digital net in base 2 is always a power of two.
The option <code>--size-parameter</code> can be used to specify the number of points of the digital net.
For instance, to specify a net with \f$2^8\f$ points, use <code>--size-parameter 2^8</code>.
For polynomial lattice rules, a default (irreducible) modulus corresponding to this number of points will be chosen;
to choose a specific modulus, one can use <code>--size-parameter</code> as they would 
\ref cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_lat_size "specify a modulus for a polynomial lattice rule". 

\subsection cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_net_specify How to construct a specific net 

Constructing a specific digital net depends on its construction method. In the Command-Line Tutorial, any occurence of
<code><var>point-set-description</var></code> or <code><var>net-description</var></code> can be replaced as follows:

- for Sobol' nets:
  \n a list of direction numbers. Direction numbers are specified as a dash-separated list of comma-separated lists of 
  integers. Each comma-separated list correspond to a coordinate. Details on direction numbers, including the number of
  direction numbers required for each coordinate, can be find \ref feats_pointsets "here". For instance <code>0-1-1,1</code>
  stands for the Sobol' net in dimension 3 with direction numbers \f$((0), (1), (1,1))\f$.
  Note that a dummy direction number equal to zero must be specified for the first coordinate. 
- for polynomial lattice rules:
  \n a (polynomial) \ref cmdtut_advanced_pointsets_lat "generating vector".
- for explicit digital nets:
  \n a dash-separated list of comma-separated lists of rows. Each comma-separated list
  correspond to a generating matrix. The rows are specified as a binary sequence without separators. For instance, 
  <code>001,010,111-110,001,111-100,110,001</code> stands for the following generating matrices :

  \f[ 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      1 & 1 & 1 
    \end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
      1 & 1 & 1 
    \end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      1 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \f]
