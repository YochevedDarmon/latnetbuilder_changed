\section feats_figures_lat_ord Figures of merit for ordinary lattice rules

LatNet Builder supports the following figures of merit for ordinary rank-1 lattices:

- The spectral figure of merit \cite vLEC00b, \cite vLEC16a using a
  term-by-term evaluation with an \f$\ell_q\f$ norm:
  \n \f$\mathcal D_{\mathfrak u}(P_n)\f$ is the normalized
  maximum distance between two successive parallel hyperplanes.
<br><br>
- The \f$\mathcal P_\alpha\f$ discrepancy \cite vSLO94a, \cite vHIC98a, \cite rNUY14a with \f$\alpha \in \{2, 4, 6, 8\}\f$, using a
  term-by-term evaluation with an \f$\ell_q\f$ norm:
    \f[
        \mathcal{D}^2_{\mathfrak u}(P_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^n 
        \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} p_{\alpha}(x_{i,j}),
    \f]
    where
    \f[
        p_{\alpha}(x) = \frac{- (-4 \pi^2)^{\alpha/2} B_{\alpha}(x)}{\alpha!}
    \f]
    with \f$B_{\alpha}\f$ the Bernouilli polynomial of even degree \f$\alpha\f$.

  If \f$ q = 2\f$, a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm can be used. This algorithm
  drastically reduces the computation time.
<br><br>
- The \f$\mathcal R_\alpha\f$ criterion \cite rNIE92b, \cite vHIC03b, with \f$\alpha \in \{1, 2, \dots, 9\}\f$,  using a
  term-by-term evaluation with an \f$\ell_q\f$ norm: 
    \f[
        \mathcal{D}^2_{\mathfrak u}(P_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^n 
        \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} r_{\alpha, n}(x_{i,j}),
    \f]
    where
    \f[
        r_{\alpha, n}(x) = \sum_{h = - \lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor }^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \max(1,|h|)^{-\alpha} e^{2 \pi i h x} - 1.
    \f]

  If \f$ q = 2\f$, a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm can be used. This algorithm
  drastically reduces the computation time.

LatNet Builder supports the following figures of merit for polynomial rank-1 lattices:

- The \f$\mathcal P_{\alpha}\f$ discrepancy \cite vLEM03a with \f$\alpha \in \{2, 4, 6, 8\}\f$ , using a
  term-by-term evaluation with an \f$\ell_q\f$ norm:
    \f[
        \mathcal{D}^2_{\mathfrak u}(P_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^n 
        \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \omega_{\alpha}(x_{i,j}),
    \f]
    where
    \f[
        \omega_{\alpha}(x) = \mu(\alpha) - 2^{(1+\lfloor \log_2(x) \rfloor) (\alpha - 1)}(\mu(\alpha) + 1),
    \f]
    where \f$ \mu(\alpha) = (1 - 2^{1- \alpha})^{-1} \f$ for even \f$ \alpha \f$.

  If \f$ q = 2\f$, a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm can be used. This algorithm
  drastically reduces the computation time.
<br><br>
- The \f$\mathcal R\f$ criterion \cite rNIE03a, using

        \mathcal{D}^2_{\mathfrak u}(P_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^n 
        \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \phi'_m(x_{i,j}),
    \f]
    where \f$m\f$ is the degree of the modulus and 
    \f[
        \phi'_m(x) = 
        \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{2}i_0 & \textrm{ if } x = \sum_{i= i_0}^{\infty} \xi_i 2^{-i}, 1 \leq i_0 \leq m, \xi_{i_0} \neq 0 \\
        1 + \frac{1}{2}m & \textrm{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \f]

  If \f$ q = 2\f$, a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm can be used. This algorithm
  drastically reduces the computation time.

\subsection feats_figures_lat_interlaced Figures of merit for interlaced polynomial lattice rules

Figures of merit specific to \ref feats_pointsets_interlaced "interlaced polynomial lattice rules" \cite rGOD13a are also supported by LatNet Builder.

These figures of merit for interlaced polynomial lattice rules in dimension \f$s\f$ can be seen as figures of merit 
for the underlying lattice rules in higher dimension \f$ds\f$, where \f$d\f$ is the interlacing factor.
If \f$P_n\f$ is the interlaced lattice rule, let \f$\bar{P}_n = \left\{(z_{0,1}, \dots, z_{0, ds}), \dots, (z_{n-1,1}, \dots, z_{n-1, ds}) \right\}\f$ denote
the underlying polynomial lattice rule in dimension \f$ds\f$.
This point of view also requires to transform (or interlace) weights in dimension \f$s\f$ into weights in dimension \f$d s\f$. 
Let \f$ \bar{\gamma} \f$ denote these interlaced weights.

The figures of merit for interlaced polynomial lattice rules supported by LatNet Builder have the following form:
\f[
    D(P_n) = \sum_{\emptyset \neq \mathfrak u \subseteq \{1, \dots, d s\}}\left(\bar{\gamma}_{\mathfrak u} D_{\mathfrak u}(\bar{P}_n)\right),
\f]

- The \f$B_{\alpha, d, (1)}\f$ interlaced discrepancy, using an \f$\ell_1\f$ norm with a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm:

    \f[
        D_{\mathfrak u}(\bar{P}_n) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \phi_{\alpha, d, (1)}(z_{i, j}),
    \f]
    where \f$ \phi_{\alpha, d, (1)}(z) \f$ is defined by:
    \f[
        \phi_{\alpha, d, (1)}(z) =
        \frac{1 - 2^{(\min(\alpha, d) -1) \lfloor \log_2(z) \rfloor} (2^{\min(\alpha, d)} -1)}{2^{(\alpha+2)/2} (2^{\min(\alpha, d) - 1} -1) }.
    \f]
    For this discrepancy, the interlaced weights are defined as:
    \f[
        \bar{\gamma}_{\mathfrak u} = \gamma_{w(\mathfrak u)} 2^{\alpha (2d-1) |w(\mathfrak u)| / 2},
    \f]
    where \f$w\f$ denotes the weights interlacing operator:
    \f[
        w(\mathfrak u) = \left\{ \left \lceil \frac{j}{d} \right\rceil, j \in \mathfrak u \right\}.
    \f]
<br><br>
- The \f$B_{d, (2)}\f$ interlaced discrepancy, using an \f$\ell_1\f$ norm with a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm:

    \f[
        D_{\mathfrak u}(\bar{P}_n) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \phi_{d, (2)}(z_{i, j}),
    \f]
    where \f$ \phi_{d, (2)}(z) \f$ is defined by:
    \f[
    \phi_{d, (2)}(z) =
    \frac{2^{d-1}(1 - 2^{(d -1) \lfloor \log_2(z) \rfloor} (2^{d} -1))}{(2^{d - 1} -1) }.
    \f]
    For this discrepancy, the interlaced weights are defined as:
    \f[
        \bar{\gamma}_{\mathfrak u} = \gamma_{w(\mathfrak u)} \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} 2^{- ( (j-1) \mod d) + 1},
    \f]
    where \f$w\f$ denotes the weights interlacing operator.
