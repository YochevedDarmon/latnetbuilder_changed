/** \page feats_figures_net Figures of merit for digital nets

LatNet Builder supports the following figures of merit for digital nets:


- The \f$\mathcal P_{\alpha}\f$ discrepancy \cite vLEM03a with \f$\alpha \in \{2, 4, 6, 8\}\f$, using a
  coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm with an \f$\ell_2\f$ norm:
    \f[
        \mathcal{D}^2_{\mathfrak u}(P_n) = \frac{1}{{n}} \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} 
        \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \omega_{\alpha}(x_{i,j}),
    \f]
    where
    \f[
        \omega_{\alpha}(x) = \mu(\alpha) - 2^{(1+\lfloor \log_2(x) \rfloor) (\alpha - 1)}(\mu(\alpha) + 1),
    \f]
    where \f$ \mu(\alpha) = (1 - 2^{1- \alpha})^{-1} \f$ for even \f$ \alpha \f$.
<br><br>
- The \f$\mathcal R\f$ criterion \cite rNIE03a, using a
  coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm with an \f$\ell_2\f$ norm:
    \f[
        \mathcal{D}^2_{\mathfrak u}(P_n) = \frac{1}{{n}} \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} 
        \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \phi'_m(x_{i,j}),
    \f]
    where \f$m\f$ is the degree of the modulus and 
    \f[
        \phi'_m(x) = 
        \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{2}i_0 & \textrm{ if } x = \sum_{i= i_0}^{\infty} \xi_i 2^{-i}, 1 \leq i_0 \leq m, \xi_{i_0} \neq 0 \\
        1 + \frac{1}{2}m & \textrm{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \f]

LatNet Builder also supports figures of merit based on the equidistribution of points.
Take a digital net \f$P_n \f$ in dimension \f$s\f$ with \f$n = 2^k\f$ points.
Suppose we divide axis \f$j\f$ in \f$2^{q_j}\f$ equal parts for some integer \f$q_j\f$, for each
\f$j\f$. This determines a partition of \f$[0,1)^s\f$ into \f$2^{q_1+\dots+q_s}\f$ rectangles of equal sizes.
If each rectangle contains exactly the same number of points, we say that the net is 
\f$(q_1,\dots,q_s)\f$-equidistributed. 

The following figures of merit are supported by LatNet Builder:

- The t-value \cite rDIC10a merit, using the fast algorithm from \cite rDIC13a, with
  weights equal to \f$\gamma_{\mathfrak u} = \mathbb{1}_{\mathfrak u = \{1, \dots, s\}} \f$ and
  an \f$\ell_{\infty}\f$ norm:
    \n \f$\mathcal{D}_{\mathfrak u}(P_n)\f$ is the t-value of the projection of \f$P_n \f$
  on \f$\mathfrak u\f$.
  The sum which defines this figure has only one term and this term equals the t-value of the net.
  The choice of weights or norm-type has no impact on the ranking of digital nets according to this figure.
  The t-value of a net with \f$n = 2^k\f$ points is the smallest \f$t\f$ such that the net is \f$(q_1,\dots,q_s)\f$-equidistributed
  whenever \f$q_1+\dots+q_s = k-t \f$.
  This figure is not available with CBC exploration methods as it cannot be computed in a CBC-way.
<br><br>
- The projection-dependent t-value \cite rJOE08a using state-of-the art algorithms,
  with an \f$\ell_q\f$ norm:
    \n \f$\mathcal{D}_{\mathfrak u}(P_n)\f$ is the t-value of the projection of \f$P_n \f$
  on \f$\mathfrak u\f$.
  Contrary to the t-value merit, this figure of merit does not only consider the t-value of the whole net but also the t-values of
  its subprojections.
<br><br>
- The projection-dependent t-value-based star discrepancy bound (Corollary 5.3 in \cite rDIC10a), using state-of-the art algorithms,
  with an \f$\ell_q\f$ norm:
    \f[
        \mathcal{D}_{\mathfrak u}(P_n) = 2^{t_{\mathfrak u}(P_n)-k} \sum_{i=0}^{|\mathfrak{u}|-1} \binom{k-t_{\mathfrak u}(P_n)}{i}
    \f] 
  where \f$t_{\mathfrak u}(P_n)\f$ is the t-value of the projection of \f$P_n \f$
  on \f$\mathfrak u\f$.
<br><br>
- The projection-dependent resolution-gap \cite rLEC04b, with an \f$\ell_q\f$ norm: 
    \n \f$\mathcal{D}_{\mathfrak u}(P_n)\f$ is the resolution-gap of the projection of \f$P_n \f$
    on \f$\mathfrak u\f$.
  The resolution of a net is the biggest \f$r\f$ such that the net is \f$(r,\dots,r)\f$-equidistributed.
  The resolution is always smaller than \f$\lfloor k/s\rfloor\f$. The resolution-gap is the difference between 
  this upper-bound and the actual resolution.

\section feats_figures_net_interlaced Figures of merit for interlaced digital nets


Figures of merit specific to \ref feats_pointsets_interlaced "interlaced digital nets" \cite rGOD13a are also supported by LatNet Builder.
These figures of merit are the same as \ref feats_figures_lat_interlaced "those used for interlaced polynomial lattice rules".
These figures of merit for interlaced digital nets in dimension \f$s\f$ can be seen as figures of merit 
for the underlying lattice rules in higher dimension \f$ds\f$, where \f$d\f$ is the interlacing factor.
If \f$P_n\f$ is the interlaced lattice rule, let \f$\bar{P}_n = \left\{(z_{0,1}, \dots, z_{0, ds}), \dots, (z_{n-1,1}, \dots, z_{n-1, ds}) \right\}\f$ denote
the underlying digital net in dimension \f$ds\f$.
This point of view also requires to transform (or interlace) weights in dimension \f$s\f$ into weights in dimension \f$d s\f$. 
Let \f$ \bar{\gamma} \f$ denote these interlaced weights.

The figures of merit for interlaced digital nets supported by LatNet Builder have the following form:
\f[
    D(P_n) = \sum_{\emptyset \neq \mathfrak u \subseteq \{1, \dots, d s\}}\left(\bar{\gamma}_{\mathfrak u} D_{\mathfrak u}(\bar{P}_n)\right),
\f]

- The \f$B_{\alpha, d, (1)}\f$ interlaced discrepancy, using an \f$\ell_1\f$ norm with a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm:

    \f[
        D_{\mathfrak u}(\bar{P}_n) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \phi_{\alpha, d, (1)}(z_{i, j}),
    \f]
    where \f$ \phi_{\alpha, d, (1)}(z) \f$ is defined by:
    \f[
        \phi_{\alpha, d, (1)}(z) =
        \frac{1 - 2^{(\min(\alpha, d) -1) \lfloor \log_2(z) \rfloor} (2^{\min(\alpha, d)} -1)}{2^{(\alpha+2)/2} (2^{\min(\alpha, d) - 1} -1) }.
    \f]
    For this discrepancy, the interlaced weights are defined as:
    \f[
        \bar{\gamma}_{\mathfrak u} = \gamma_{w(\mathfrak u)} 2^{\alpha (2d-1) |w(\mathfrak u)| / 2},
    \f]
    where \f$w\f$ denotes the weights interlacing operator:
    \f[
        w(\mathfrak u) = \left\{ \left \lceil \frac{j}{d} \right\rceil, j \in \mathfrak u \right\}.
    \f]
<br><br>
- The \f$B_{d, (2)}\f$ interlaced discrepancy, using an \f$\ell_1\f$ norm with a coordinate-uniform evaluation algorithm:

    \f[
        D_{\mathfrak u}(\bar{P}_n) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} \phi_{d, (2)}(z_{i, j}),
    \f]
    where \f$ \phi_{d, (2)}(z) \f$ is defined by:
    \f[
    \phi_{d, (2)}(z) =
    \frac{2^{d-1}(1 - 2^{(d -1) \lfloor \log_2(z) \rfloor} (2^{d} -1))}{(2^{d - 1} -1) }.
    \f]
    For this discrepancy, the interlaced weights are defined as:
    \f[
        \bar{\gamma}_{\mathfrak u} = \gamma_{w(\mathfrak u)} \prod_{j \in \mathfrak u} 2^{- ( (j-1) \mod d) + 1},
    \f]
    where \f$w\f$ denotes the weights interlacing operator.
