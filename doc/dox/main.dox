\section overview Overview

<strong>LatNet Builder</strong> is a software library and tool for constructing highly-uniform point sets for quasi Monte-Carlo 
and randomized quasi Monte-Carlo methods using state-of-the-art techniques. The software can construct rank-1 lattices and digital nets 
in base 2.

This software is based on a previous version called <a href="https://github.com/umontreal-simul/latnetbuilder/tree/v1.5.0"> Lattice Builder</a>.
The reference for this previous version can be found below:
<blockquote>
<a href="https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/myftp/papers/latbuilder-final.pdf">
P. L'Ecuyer and D. Munger.
<b>LatticeBuilder: A General Software Tool for Constructing Rank-1 Lattice Rules.</b>
ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 42, 2, Article 15 (May 2016), 30 pages.
</a>
</blockquote>

The current version of the software is called LatNet Builder, for Lattice & Net Builder, as it handles both rank-1 lattices and digital nets in base 2.
